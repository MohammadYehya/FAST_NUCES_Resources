1. What is the advantage of using Hadoop for big data processing?
Hadoop provides a scalable and fault-tolerant platform for processing large amounts of data across multiple servers in a cluster, enabling faster and more efficient data processing.

2.How does Hadoop handle data backup and recovery?
Hadoop provides backup and recovery mechanisms such as checkpointing, journaling, and backup nodes to ensure data availability and recoverability in case of failures.

3.How does HDFS ensure data reliability?
HDFS replicates data across multiple servers in the cluster, typically three times, to ensure that data is not lost in case of server failures.

4.What role does the NameNode play in HDFS, and why is it a potential single point of failure?
The NameNode is the master server in HDFS responsible for metadata and namespace information. It is a potential single point of failure, and its high availability is crucial for the system's reliability.

5.How does HDFS handle data consistency in a distributed environment?
HDFS follows a write-once, read-many model, where data is written once and remains immutable. This simplifies data consistency in a distributed environment.

6.What is the significance of the block-based storage model in HDFS?
HDFS stores data in fixed-size blocks, typically 128MB or 256MB in size. This approach facilitates efficient data processing, minimizes data movement, and enhances fault tolerance.

7.How does the BackupNode stay synchronized with the active NameNode?
The BackupNode synchronizes with the active NameNode by periodically fetching the namespace changes (edits) and applying them to its own namespace copy.

8.In the event of a NameNode failure, how does the BackupNode take over as the active NameNode?
When the primary NameNode fails, the BackupNode can transition to the active state by promoting itself and assuming the responsibilities of the primary NameNode.

9.What role does the CheckpointNode play in the HDFS architecture?
he CheckpointNode is responsible for creating periodic checkpoints of the namespace in HDFS. It offloads the checkpointing workload from the primary NameNode.

10.How does the CheckpointNode prevent overloading the primary NameNode during checkpointing?
The CheckpointNode periodically creates a checkpoint of the namespace, which involves reading the filesystem metadata, thus reducing the load on the primary NameNode.
