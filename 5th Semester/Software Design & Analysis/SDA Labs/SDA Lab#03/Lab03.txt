You also need to draw an activity diagram for
the ATM system.


The
case study is given below


Initially, the customer
arrived at an ATM booth and inserted the card into the machine. The ATM machine
verifies the validity of the card first. If the card is valid, it proceeds;
otherwise, it ejects the card. Until the card validation has been performed,
the customer will need to wait for a while (30 sec). Once the validation is
completed, the machine asks for the PIN code. At this stage, the customer can
also cancel the action without entering the PIN code (result
ATM card will be ejected). The validity of the PIN code is checked. The
customer needs to wait for some time (30 sec) until the PIN code validation has
been performed. If the customer enters an invalid pin code, then the ATM
machine will eject the card, and the transaction has been terminated. If the
customer inputs a valid pin code, then the ATM machine displays various
transaction options. The customer can select only one transaction from the
available options. The customer can use the cancel option to reverse the action
(result ATM card will be ejected). Once a specific
transaction has been selected for processing, it is carried out until it is
completed. A receipt or invoice is generated in parallel with the transaction,
and the customer's bank account is updated as well. The ATM machine repeatedly
displays the available transaction options unless the customer explicitly
cancels the action. Once the transaction has been completed, the ATM machine
ejects the ATM card.
