Bank Automated Teller Machine (ATM)
Initially, the ATM is turned off. After the power supply is turned on, the ATM starts performing the startup
action and enters into the Self Test state. If the test fails, the ATM will enter into the Out Of Service state,
or it will undergo a tigerless transition to the Idle state. This is the state where the customer waits for
the interaction.
Whenever the customer inserts the bank or credit card in the ATM's card reader, the ATM state changes
from Idle to Serving Customer, the entry action readCard is performed after entering into Serving
Customer state. Since the customer can cancel the transaction at any instant, so the transition from Serving
Customer state back to the Idle state could be triggered by cancel event.
