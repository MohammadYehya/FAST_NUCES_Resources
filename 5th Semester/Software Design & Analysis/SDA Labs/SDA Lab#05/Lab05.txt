Create a sequence diagram:




Let's assume changing the channel of your television using a remote
control. The TV viewer starts the entire process. The use of the remote which
will then interact with the TV. Let's assume the TV is already on and the TV
viewer wants to change her channel. The first thing that happens is the TV
viewer presses the numbers on the remote to tell it which channel to go to. The
remote then sends a new message to the television to change the channel to number
and TV will display the desired channel. If TV viewer is unsure what channel to
go to and would like to surf the channels until they find a channel they like
The TV viewer is going to press the up or down arrow on the remote to browse
through the channels. This sends a message to the remote. The remote will then
send a message to the TV with this action. Just like in the initial sequence,
the TV changes the channel and displays that to the TV viewer.
