K213309 DB Assignment#1 Q1
●Databases handle all of the complicated implications of using a file system.
 Like storing things in a file and worrying about how they are stored.
 Or improved lookups which is difficult in files.
 Or even Independent scaling which means that databases can be sized up or down  independently to your application.
 It wouldn't make sense to use a Database when the advantages of using a Database  aren't needed as using a Database involves cost and overhead to purchase and  maintain it.

●A DBA is responsible for designing the logical and physical schemas, as well as  widely used portions of the external schema. They are also responsible for  security and authorisation.
 A DBA needs to understand query optimization even if they are not interested in  runnung their own because some of the responsibilities are related to query  optimization.

●DDL is important in representing information because it is used to describe  external and logical schemas.
 DML is used to access and update data.
 Buffer Manager is not very important for representing data because its job is to  bring arbitrary disk pages into main memory.
 The data model is fundamental to representing data. The model determines what  representation mechanisms are supported by the DBMS.
