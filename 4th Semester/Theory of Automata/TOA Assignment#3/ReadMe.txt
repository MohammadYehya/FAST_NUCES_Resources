We have provided two different C++ files as we couldn't get the exact output, but got similar outputs.
	One of them is implemented by the Predictive LL(1) parsing technique. This was done by implementing a parse table and predicting the output.
	However, the language was modified a bit as to use this technique we need to eliminate Left Recursion.

	The second one is implemented by a normal recursion tactic which recursively uses the program stack and finds the output.
